    longDescription: "**IGNITION** (aka GOAL_BREAKER.EXE) is a mission-control platform that transforms vague objectives into precise, executable tactical plans. It takes a signal like 'Launch a startup' and returns a **5-step tactical breakdown** with complexity scores, filtering out the noise.\n\n• **Precision Breakdown**: Generates 5 chronological, high-impact steps. No fluff.\n• **Deep Dive Subroutines**: Recursively breaks down any step into 3 specific tactical sub-actions.\n• **Active Guardrails**: Dedicated AI model classifies input as OK, GIBBERISH, or ABUSE, handling errors in-character.\n• **Bilingual Ops**: Native support for **English** and **Amharic**, adapting the 'Dark Technical' tone to both.\n• **Haptic Audio Layer**: Immersive feedback with mechanical key clicks, processing hums, and success chimes.\n\nBuilt with a **Dark Technical** UI for focused execution.",
